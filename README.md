# Personal Web Page
- Here is the start of my personal webpage to display information about me, and work that I've done.
- I used React to construct the webpage, and used JavaScript to handle events and toggle react renders. All styling has been done using sass css. I imported icons from feather icons, a neat database of lightweight icons for use.

# Barebones React/TypeScript/Express/Sass Boilerplate
This project is a starting point for a TypeScript based React app that also has a local API server using express.

There are 2 different Webpack configurations. One for the server and one for the client.
